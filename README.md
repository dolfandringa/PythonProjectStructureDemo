# Structuring Your Python Project

A collaborative article (and demo repository) discussing good practices in setting up a Python project.
The final article will be published on [dev.to()][1].

This project was born out of a long and surprisingly difficult discussion on #python (Freenode IRC), wherein
the three of us concluded there was a lack of decent guidance on how to set up a new Python project.
